# Results

## Data

The proposed dataset contains 100000 images of 200 classes (500 for each class) downsized to 64Ã—64 colored images. Each class has 500 training images, 50 validation images and 50 test images.

## Decision

To start, I launched baseline and got about 40% score with ResNet-18. The next step was to use pre-trained ResNet with a frozen feature extractor. 
After some experiments with the baseline, I introduced several features to improve the performance:

- Tuned lr and added StepLR scheduler
- Added data augmentation (RandomHorizontalFlip) and resized the image to 224x224. 
- Used pretrained efficientnet-b3 

For the feature extractor, the learning rate was set to 1e-3 and for head - 1e-2. So, I fine-tuned this network and got 0.81 accuracy.

## TODO:

- [ ] Efficientnet v2
- [ ] Tune optimizer params
- [ ] Implement some sota for this task (e.g. Direction Concentration Learning)
- [ ] Add more data augmentation (e.g random rotation, random crop, random brightness)
